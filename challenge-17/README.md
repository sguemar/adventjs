# The madness of sending parcels this season

Parcel companies ðŸ“¦ are preparing for the festive season and the madness of deliveries that awaits them.

The company operates fleets of vans ðŸš› and trucks ðŸšš. The fleets have an organization chart, as there are experience level ranges.

We need to know the number of parcels a person will be able to handle in a day. This is done by counting the number of parcels that person can carry and **all the carriers he has in his team**. The problem is that the data is stored in a rather strange way in an array:

- The array contains other arrays that contain the data for each carrier
- `carrier[0]` -> Name/ID of the carrier
- `carrier[1]` -> Packets handled in a day
- `carrier[2]` -> Array with his subordinates

To see it in code, both the array and the two-parameter function to get the desired number:

```JavaScript
const carriers = [
  ['dapelu', 5, ['midu', 'jelowing']],
  ['midu', 2, []],
  ['jelowing', 2, []]
]

countPackages(carriers, 'dapelu') // 9
// 5 of dapelu, 2 of midu and 2 of jelowing = 9

const carriers2 = [
  ['lolivier', 8, ['camila', 'jesuspoleo']],
  ['camila', 5, ['sergiomartinez', 'conchaasensio']],
  ['jesuspoleo', 4, []],
  ['sergiomartinez', 4, []],
  ['conchaasensio', 3, ['facundocapua', 'faviola']],
  ['facundocapua', 2, []],
  ['faviola', 1, []]
]

countPackages(carriers2, 'camila') // 15
// 5 of camila, 4 of sergiomartinez, 3 of conchaasensio, 2 of facundocapua and 1 of faviola = 15
```

**Be careful!** As you have seen in the second example, **the flowchart can have different levels and we also get information that we may not need**. We must take into account the `carrierID` parameter to calculate the number correctly and count all his team.
